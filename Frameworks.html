            Frameworks/Libraries are used for making web apps. Libraries come packed with prebuilt functionalities that make implementing certain features 
            easier. For example, React and Angular allow for easier UI design with web Applications. Node.js and Nest.js are examples of libraries that are used
            for backend. 

            <h2>Angular</h2>
            <p>
                Angular is a powerful and widely-used framework that simplifies the development of dynamic and single-page web applications, 
                revolutionizing the way we build and interact with web content

                Key features

                    <li>Two way data Binding</li>
                    <li>Dependency injection</li>
                </ul>
                To make an angular project, you need to install node js and the angular cli. then run <code>ng new myapp</code> 
                and <code>code myapp</code> to open the angular app in Visual Studio Code
            <h3>Angular Workspace:</h3>
            In the Explorer section, you will see all the files of the Angular Project. <br>
            <code>node_modules</code> contains all the libraries that are necessary to the angular project's functioning. 
           <br> type <code>ng serve myapp</code> in the terminal to get a default angular app. 
            
            <br><br>
            As a platform, Angular includes a component-based framework for building scalable web applications. 
            Components are architectural building blocks encapsulating templates, data and behavior. 
            This facilitates the creation of reusable and modular UI elements, streamlining development and enhancing maintainability. 
            This video goes a little deeper on how angular works.

            <!-- React Section -->
            <h2>React JS</h2>
            <p>React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. 
                Developed and maintained by Facebook, React is widely used for creating dynamic and 
                interactive web applications with a focus on a reusable and declarative approach to building UI components.
            <br>To make a React app, make sure you have node.js installed, and type <code>create-react-app myapp</code></p><br>
            This will create a new directory that contains your new react app.              
            </p>
            
            <div class = "imgcontainer" style="display: flex">
                <img src="assets/media/app.js.png" alt="" style="height:500%; width: 500%;">
                <div>
                    
                    App.js is your main html page. It returns a javascript 
                    function, which contains html componenets. <br>
                    To make a test build of the app, type <code>npx start</code> in the terminal, with the react app as the working directory
